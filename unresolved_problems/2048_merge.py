Tiles should slide left, equal number pairs should get merged.
As you work on your merge function, here are some simple tests you should try:

[2, 0, 2, 4] should return [4, 4, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 2, 2] should return [4, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 2, 0, 0] should return [4, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2] should return [4, 4, 2, 0, 0]
[8, 16, 16, 8] should return [8, 32, 8, 0]
